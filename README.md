# smdb - simsine Movie DataBase

smdb is a website created to combine the best of services like IMDb, Letterboxd, MyAnimeList and more into a single application.
This is because i found these to lack certain features when it comes to tracking movies watched aswell as progress in watching series.

## Technologies

As for information on the movies we want to track we fetch this from the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) which is a public API serving information based on IMDb.

The application uses the [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) fullstack web framework. This allows for responsive web pages that can interface directly with the backend via serverside actions.

On the backend we use the [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) which is a JavaScript ORM that allows for easy database schema and CRUD operation. It also has a system for strong typing via auto-generated TypeScript interfaces.

[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) is the database of choice for this application for what should be obvious reasons.

[lucia-auth](https://lucia-auth.com) for simple session authentication

## Developing

Requirements for developing this application includes:

-   NodeJS
-   pnpm or the nodejs package-manager of your choice
-   Development Postgres instance via Docker or other means

You must first set the correct enviornment variables for the project, copy the example file with the following command

```sh
cp .env.example .env && nano .env
```

- SECRET_APIKEY is an API key for the OMDb API
- DATABASE_URL is the connection url for the postgres database

Then you must install the dependencies using the following command

```sh
pnpm i
```

Then you must have an active Postgres instance, this can be done easiest with the following command

```sh
docker run --name smdb-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d -p 5432:5432 postgres:alpine
```

When you make changes to the schema you can generate new bindings by running
```sh
pnpx prisma generate
```

New database migrations can be made with the following command when changes have been made to the schema.

```sh
pnpx prisma migrate dev --name ""
```
